=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

It is my belief that no work is truly original as every creation stands on the shoulders of giants whether the influence is conscious or not.

This work could not have been possible without the excellent work of many other people here I list some of the obvious influences and direct contributions.

## BASH

None of this would be possible without Brian Fox's bash(1). Thanks to Chet Ramey for patiently answering my questions on the bash(1) mailing list.

## HTTP

The http(3) module is a wrapper for the excellent curl(1), thanks to Daniel Stenberg and all the other contributors.

## RONN

Man page documentation thanks to Ryan Tomayko, see ronn(1).

## JSON

The json module was based on code by Dominic Tarr, see json-sh(1).

## RUBY

Inspiration from ruby(3) for method naming conventions.
