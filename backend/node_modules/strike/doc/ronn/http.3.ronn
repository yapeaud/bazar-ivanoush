http(3) -- http(s) module using curl(1) 
=============================================

## DESCRIPTION

The http(3) module wraps curl(1) to provide easy access to HTTP(S) functionality from `bash` programs. Note that the http(3) module is configured to follow redirects in the 3xx status code range and therefore multiple response headers may be available.

## FILES

The http(3) module generates some temporary files and some files used for logging purposes stored in the `$HOME/.strike/http` directory.

## TEMPORARY FILES

These are files that correspond to the last request made by the http(3) module.

* `http.out`:
	Raw output from executing curl(1).
* `http.head.dump`:
	Raw response headers.
* `http.head`:
	Response headers (without the HTTP status line).
* `http.body`:
	Body of the response.
* `http.trace`:
	Trace output generated by curl(1).
* `http.trace.ascii`:
	ASCII trace output generated by curl(1).
* `http.exit`:
	Contains a non-zero exit code for curl(1).
* `http.stderr`:
	Contains the stderr output when curl(1) exits with a non-zero exit code.
* `http.stdout`:
	Contains the curl(1) stdout output.
* `http.config`:
	A configuration file corresponding to the last request suitable for passing to the `--config` option of curl(1).
